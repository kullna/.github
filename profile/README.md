# The Kullna Programming Language Project

Welcome to the **Kullna Programming Language Project** - a free-to-use and open-source initiative that makes learning to code fun and easy for everyone!

## :star: Our Mission

Our mission is simple yet profound: **to open a door into the world of coding for children worldwide**. To realize this mission, we are crafting a unique programming language that empowers users to code in their native tongue.

We see this mission as a stepping stone to a future where every child, regardless of their background, can have their voice heard in the digital realm. By lowering the barriers to code we're fostering confidence, sparking wonder, and celebrating the rich tapestry of their unique cultures. We assure them that they are valued and have a crucial place in this global conversation.

This isn't just about learning to code; it's about opening doors, fostering empathy and mutual understanding. Every child we reach out to is a ripple of positive change, engaging with the world in ways they might not have otherwise been able to. And as they step into this new world, they bring with them their unique perspectives, fostering a world that is richer, more compassionate, and more understanding.

We recognize that every child holds immense potential, and it is our goal to help them discover their capacity for creation and innovation.

Our aspiration is to cultivate a love for learning, stimulate boundless curiosity, and bolster the confidence of every child. We want them to understand that they have the potential to change the world.

In our mission, we see the potential for a better future for all of us. We're taking it one line of code at a time.

## :wave: Our Story

My name is Steven Wright, the original creator of Kullna. As a software engineer, ex-Googler, and a two-time founder of successful tech startups, I've been fortunate to have a career that lets me do what I love every day â€“ programming. A passion sparked when I was just 10 years old, finding a manual for BASIC and teaching myself how to code on our home computer.

Back then, coding was simpler. GW BASIC allowed me to create graphics and sounds with easy-to-understand commands. Coding was approachable and fun, offering a world of creativity without needless complexity. This early start opened doors for me, landing me my first job at 16, and setting the stage for a fruitful career. This should be the story of every aspiring coder.

However, I've come to realize that not everyone is as fortunate. Many face an uphill battle due to language barriers, lack of resources, or lack of support. Over the years, I've been inspired by the resilience and determination of people who have overcome immense obstacles to learn to code, significantly transforming their lives and those around them. This has left a profound impact on me, sparking a desire to create a similar pathway for others.

Enter Kullna - an open-source programming language designed to democratize coding and make it accessible, enjoyable, and empowering. Kullna, Arabic for "all of us," is inspired by the simplicity and power of 80s coding languages, but enhanced to cater to modern needs. It's designed to be accessible and intuitive, yet robust enough to be practical for beginners, without requiring complex setups or installations.

While there are commendable efforts to create non-English-centric languages, we've noticed there's a niche yet to be fully explored - a language that's not only accessible and beginner-friendly, but also rich in learning-oriented features. Drawing inspiration from these pioneering projects, we developed Kullna, empowering users to understand and write code in their native tongue. But we've gone further - we wanted our language to support growth as a coder. That's why we've incorporated features like debugging, critical for learning from mistakes and improving. Kullna is our love letter to all aspiring coders; promising an introduction to programming principles in the warm, familiar embrace of their mother tongue while giving them the tools necessary to create, explore, and grow.

And yes, coding should be fun! That's why we've incorporated libraries that let you create games with graphics and sounds - reminiscent of my own coding beginnings with GW BASIC. We believe these features inspire creativity and make learning to code an enjoyable journey.

We're working tirelessly from San Francisco, CA, and Baghdad, Iraq, to make this vision a reality, with the ultimate aim of removing the barriers in the path of those eager to learn and grow in the world of coding. Kullna isn't just about code; it's about the stories each line of code can tell, the doors it can open, and the opportunities it can create. It's about ensuring that everyone, regardless of their language or background, can have the same opportunities I was fortunate enough to have.

I invite you to join us in this mission. Let's work together to create a world where coding truly is for "all of us."
